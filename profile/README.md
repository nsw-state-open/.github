This meet is ratified by World Athletics and Athletics Australia. Athletes can qualify for international and national competition, accumulate World Athletics ranking points, break Athletics NSW and Athletics Australian records, and have their performances added to World Athletics top lists. 

With the PINK concert on Saturday, there will be limited parking avaliable and high levels of traffic in and around Sydney Olympic Park. Please plan your travel arrangements accordingly.

As a result, ANSW have organised a parking pass which athletes/spectator may show to the security at P2 parking. Please note this does not guarenteed entry, but provides preferred/prioritised entry into the P2 parking area.
